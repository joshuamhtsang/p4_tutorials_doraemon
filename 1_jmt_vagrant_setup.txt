### Vagrant VM Setup ###
########################

Follow the instructions in the official README.md
to install vagrant, virtual box and run:

$ vagrant up

in the vm-ubuntu-20.04/ directory.  A guest OS gui
should appear at the end.  Login with:

User: p4
PW: p4

I like to change some things in the Vagrantfile:

1.  By default, Vagrant mounts the directory containing
the Vagrantfile to /vagrant/ directory inside the guest
VM.  However, P4 tutorials disable this in their
Vagrantfile.  Re-enable mounting and point to root of
'tutorial_jmt' repo'.  Change the line inside
'./vm-ubuntu-20.04/Vagrantfile' from:

    config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', disabled: true

to:

    config.vm.synced_folder './..', '/vagrant', disabled: false

Inside the guest OS, if you 'cd' to:

$ cd /vagrant/

You should see the 'exercises/' directory.
