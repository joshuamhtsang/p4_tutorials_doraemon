### Vagrant VM Setup ###
########################

Follow the instructions in the official README.md
to install vagrant, virtual box and run:

$ vagrant up

in the vm-ubuntu-20.04/ directory.  I like to change
some things in the Vagrantfile:

1. By default, Vagrant mounts the directory containing
the Vagrantfile to /vagrant/ directory inside the guest
VM.  However, P4 tutorials disable this in their
Vagrantfile.  So re-enable it by commenting the line:

#   config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', disabled: true
